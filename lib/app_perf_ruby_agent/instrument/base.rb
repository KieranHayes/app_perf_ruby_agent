    # Base class for System Metric instruments. The default implementations
    # for the methods in this class are all based on a regular expression
    # that is matched against a pattern. Custom intruments that simply need
    # to match against a notfication name can easily extend this class like:
    #
    #   class SearchInstrument < AppPerf::Instrument::Base
    #     def initialize
    #       super /search$/
    #     end
